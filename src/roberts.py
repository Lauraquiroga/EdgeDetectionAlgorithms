Code adapted from: https://github.com/adamiao/sobel-filter-tutorial/blob/master/sobel_from_scratch.py
    Modified by Emon Sarker (emondsarker) on March 26, 2025
    Changes: 
    - Kernel Definition: The Sobel kernels (sobelx and sobely) have been replaced with the 2x2 Roberts Cross kernels (robertsx and robertsy).
    - Convolution Operation: The Sobel filter operates on 3x3 patches, whereas the Roberts filter operates on 2x2 patches.
    - Loop Range: The loop for applying the filter is adjusted to iterate over smaller 2x2 regions instead of 3x3 regions.
    - Edge Magnitude Calculation: In the find_edges method, the gradient magnitudes are calculated based on the Roberts filter's results using the 2x2 kernels.

    Class implementing the Roberts Cross algorithm for edge detection

    The Roberts Cross operator performs a simple, quick to compute, 2-D spatial gradient measurement on an image.
    It was one of the first edge detectors and was initially proposed by Lawrence Roberts in 1963.
    
    The operator consists of a pair of 2Ã—2 convolution kernels:
    Gx = [[ 1, 0],      Gy = [[ 0, -1],
          [ 0,-1]]            [ 1,  0]]
