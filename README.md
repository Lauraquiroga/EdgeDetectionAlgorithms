# Edge Detection Algorithms
Advanced Algorithms (COSC 520) - Project     
Authors: Ladan Tazik, Laura Quiroga, Emon Sarker     
      
Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing and computer vision. This usually corresponds to object boundaries. This project implements and compares numerically three widely used edge detection algorithms: Sobel, Roberts Cross, and Canny. 


## Project Structure

## Setup instructions   
Follow these steps to run the project:
1. **Clone the project**      
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lauraquiroga/EdgeDetectionAlgorithms.git
   cd EdgeDetectionAlgorithms
   ```

2.  **Install dependencies**     
   Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.     
   Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended version for the virtual environment: Python 3.12.7).       

   Install requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt file.       
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3.  **Run the project**      
Run the project from the root folder.       
   ```bash
   python main.py # or use python3 main.py if needed
   ```
   This will    
   TO-DO    
   
4.  **Run the unit tests**       
   To run the test cases use the following command.       
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests # or use python3 -m unittest discover -s tests if needed
   ```
